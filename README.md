# Mitigating Hallucination in Financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Fine-Grained Knowledge Verification

This repository primarily consists of two parts: our RLFKV code implementation and the Financial Data Fidelity Evaluation Dataset FDD-ANT, which includes various types of data such as stocks, funds, and macroeconomics.


## RLFKV Implementation Details
Our RLFKV addresses hallucination mitigation in financial text generation through fine-grained knowledge verification. The implementation is built on the [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift) framework, with the core contribution being the [RLFKV](./code/ms-swift-rlfkv/examples/train/grpo/plugin/plugin.py) function.

This method decomposes long-form responses into fine-grained atomic knowledge units and verifies the factual accuracy of each unit, providing granular signals to guide the model during reinforcement fine-tuning. The prompt template is available at [figs/prompt_template.jpg](figs/prompt_template.jpg). 
 
 **Once our paper is accepted, we will upload the code.**

## FDD-ANT Details



The comparative analysis with BizFinBench's [FDD](https://github.com/HiThink-Research/BizFinBench/blob/main/datasets/Financial_Data_Description.jsonl) reveals the following advantages of FDD-ANT: Superior coverage (3 financial data types versus FDD's single type) and Enhanced complexity (13Ã— longer average context length).

| Dimension          | FDD              | FDD-ANT        |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Data Types**     | Stocks only      | Stocks, Funds, Macro |
| **Data Volume**    | 1,461 samples    | 2,000 samples    |
| **Avg. Length**    | 506 tokens       | 6,763 tokens     |
